# Sunday Puzzle

This is an open-source pet project, feel free to contribute.

## Backstory

My partner and I enjoy trying to solve [NPR's Sunday Puzzle](https://www.npr.org/series/4473090/sunday-puzzle). We are both avid crossword solvers and big Will Shortz fans. We try to solve the Sunday Puzzle over breakfast and, usually, one of us figures it out over the course of a few days.

Of course sometimes I get the itch to algorithmically solve them. Because it's fun! And especially fun if we can't figure it out in the week that's been allotted to us.

## Repo

The repository is setup to include the name of the puzzle as a separate folder. Most of my solves will be written in JavaScript of some kind. I'll include the puzzle description and steps to reproduce the solve in a file called `PUZZLE.md`
